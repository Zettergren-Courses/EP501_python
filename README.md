# EP501_python

Python scripts for EP501.  This repository is very much a work-in-progress.  I will be updating it throughout the semester as I port more of my codes from the MATLAB repository for EP501 over to python.  Many of the MATLAB codes will eventually be ported, but I can't gaurantee that they all will by the end of the semester.  Either way you are free to use python to complete your assignments.  


## Codes updated for FA2020 semester

### Basic python functionality
